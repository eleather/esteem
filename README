spec/requests - Request specs test the information and functional elements (links, buttons, form elements) displayed on a page.  You shouldn't be checking layout, the existence of headers or pretty colours, or anything else related to the formatting of the content.  The intent of these tests is only to verify that the information does appear on the page.
